	 * Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
	 * A new java.util.stream has been added in Java 8 to perform filter/map/reduce like operations with the collection. 
	 * Stream API will allow sequential as well as parallel execution. 
	 * This is one of the best feature for me because I work a lot with Collections and usually with Big Data, 
	 * we need to filter out them based on some conditions.
	 * 
	 * Collection interface has been extended with stream() and parallelStream() default methods to get 
	 * the Stream for sequential and parallel execution. Letâ€™s see their usage with simple example.
	 * 
	 * Notice that parallel processing values are not in order, so parallel processing will be very helpful while working with huge collections.
	 * Covering everything about Stream API is not possible in this post, 
	 * you can read everything about Stream API at Java 8 Stream API Example Tutorial : https://www.journaldev.com/2774/java-8-stream
